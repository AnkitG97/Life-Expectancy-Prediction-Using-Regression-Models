# Life-Expectancy-Prediction-Using-Regression-Models

## Objective: 
Developed regression models to predict life expectancy by analyzing its relationship with various global health indicators.

## Scope of Work:
Conducted exploratory data analysis on WHO data spanning 2000â€“2015 to identify key predictors.
Applied feature engineering, capping outliers, addressing multicollinearity, and non-linear transformations.
Used regression techniques aligned with Gauss-Markov theory to ensure unbiased estimators and minimized error.
Enhanced model performance through feature selection and simplification while maintaining accuracy.

## Outcome: 
Delivered a model with high predictive confidence and clear error accountability to better explain life expectancy trends.
